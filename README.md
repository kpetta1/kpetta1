## Hi, I'm Kay! Welcome to my Realm 🧙‍♀️✨

🔐 Cybersecurity student • 👩🏽‍💻 Aspiring Pentester • 💡 Life-long technologist

### 💼 What I Do
- Support enterprise infrastructure across IBM iSeries/AS400 environments with a focus on automation, uptime, and secure operations
- Monitor system logs and alerts using tools like QSYSOPR, ROBOT Scheduler, and Smart Operator — identifying and resolving failures across critical subsystems
- Handle secure data transmission (GoAnywhere, PGP), backup verification, and job scheduling across production and development
- Investigate errors, analyze logs, and assist in subsystem recovery — often mirroring Tier 1 SOC triage and incident response practices
- Collaborate with cybersecurity engineers, programmers, and compliance teams to maintain system integrity and operational resilience

### 🧠 What I'm Learning
- Offensive security techniques: recon, enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation (Linux/Windows)
- Web app security: XSS, SQLi, IDOR, CSRF, authentication bypass, Burp Suite
- Vulnerability assessment: Nmap, Shodan, Gobuster, CVE research, ExploitDB
- Scripting & automation: Bash, Python (recon tools, reporting, basic automation)
- Digital forensics & IR fundamentals: FTK Imager, Autopsy, log analysis, evidence handling
- Security operations: SIEM basics, incident triage, report writing & remediation documentation

### 🛠️ Current Projects
- Building a home lab with vulnerable machines and AD simulation
- Publishing writeups from TryHackMe, CTFs, and forensic labs
- Scripting custom tools for enumeration and recon (Bash/Python)
- Developing a GitHub portfolio to document tools, techniques, and methodologies
